- Explain in detail why these tests might be helpful in the future

It is important to know what the outcome of the ECS script will be for a multitude of reasons:
	Remembering the purpose of the script.
	Recognizing what outputs are currently expected such that we can maintain backwards compatibility if the script changes.
	Validating that the output is still consistent in the event that the docker base image that the script pulls changes.
	Validating that the script does what it is supposed to do and maintains whatever handshake contract the script is designed to accommodate.
	Tests could be a helpful baseline in the event we build out the scripts to support lots of different Gateway API calls.
	Implementing the steps with regex to validate that things like the arn specifications are adhered to, the string output is exactly correct, the cluster arn is in a valid format, etc.
	
Testing script integration points in a continuous integration cycle will notice if anything breaks as quickly as possible, so including the tests with implemented steps in a pipeline of some kind will expose if and when anything undesirable gets introduced.
